This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a simple dictionary web app. Users can input a word to get its definition, part of speech, phonetic pronunciation, and example usage. The design features a clean interface with a search box, and it retrieves data from the `"https://api.dictionaryapi.dev"` API. Additionally, it includes styling with the Poppins font and a responsive container. The JavaScript handles user input, fetches data from the API, and supports audio playback of word pronunciation.
